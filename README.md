_*Epicodus Javascript Independent Project 1-20-17*_

_*Project Name: Angular2 JS Independent Project *_

##Meal Tracker (calorie-counter) Project Description:
Create a meal tracking application. Users should be able to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories. Assignment assumes foods being logged are for a single day.

For example:

```
---------
Name: "Hamburger"
Details: "Didn't get a soda or cheese on my burger!"
Calories: 354
---------

---------
Name: "Fries"
Details: "I only ate half of them."
Calories: 365
---------
```

###As a user...

- [ ] I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
- [ ] I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
- [ ] I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
- [ ] I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).


###Further Exploration

- [ ] Custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile.
- [ ] Display of the total number of calories consumed in a day, and/or the average number of calories consumed in a day.
- [ ] Add a property that records when each food was eaten. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
- [ ] Expand the application to display multiple days of food logs. Group the food entries by day. Then include a component to display the total calories for whichever day the user selects.
- [ ] Add a new master component to average the total calories consumed per day so that the user can figure out how much exercise they should be getting on a regular basis.

###Objectives

- [ ] Application uses a model to organize data.
- [ ] Components are used to create display and behavior for your templates.
- [ ] TypeScript is used throughout application; including variable data types.
- [ ] Users can create and edit instances of a model.
- [ ] Models can be filtered using a pipe.
- [ ] Edit/update form supports two-way data binding
- [ ] Dependencies are managed with npm and Bower.
- [ ] Application includes a gulp-based asset pipeline with a development server, and all necessary build tasks.
- [ ] Application works as expected.
- [ ] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [ ] Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.
- [ ] Project demonstrates understanding of the week's concepts. If prompted, I should be able to discuss code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

##SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

This following portion of this README outlines the details of reviewing this Angular2 application. Angular2 is a Model View Controller (MVC) framework built entirely on the client side. Angular2 uses components to control the data display and functionality, so it is also known as a Model View Component framework.


### Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (with NPM)
* [Atom and Atom Typescript Package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript/)

Clone the repository (address below) and follow the steps below to view and edit the application:

### Installation

1. `git clone <repository-url>` this repository (address below)
2. `cd meals-test`
3. `npm install typescript -g`
4. `apm install atom-typescript` (restart atom after this step)
5. `npm install`
6. `bower install`
7. `gulp build`
8. `gulp serve`
